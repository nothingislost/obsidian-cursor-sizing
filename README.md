Super simple Obsidian plugin that changes the CodeMirror option for the cursor sizing.

Forked and modified from the orginal Obsidian-Cursor-Blink plugin by @xnhp https://github.com/xnhp/obsidian-cursor-blink

Note: this will only work on the desktop version of Obsdidian and will almost assuredly break after the migration to CodeMirror 6
